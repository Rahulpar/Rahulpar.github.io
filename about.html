                                    Darshini has also become a category of restaurants in Karnataka which serves fresh

                                                went in pursuit of an IT career to different countries in the world.
                                                While
                                                travelling in different part of the world, one thing he observed in
                                                common was
                                                the lack of Authentic Indian food, it was such a rarity that he started
                                                cooking
                                                not only for himself but for his colleagues and friends. The practice of
                                                cooking
                                                for large numbers has never left him and the volume of people visiting
                                                his home
                                                has been ever increasing. He not only enjoys cooking but feels immensely
                                                happy
                                                to serve his friends with a smile.</p>

                                                25 years after opening his first restaurant, the passion, nostalgia and
                                                the quest
                                                for authentic food has come back to haunt Shailu and he was eagerly
                                                looking
                                                forward to open a restaurant in the Brampton and Mississauga area of

                                                A fight for survival and facing challenges head on is not new to Shailu,
                                                not
                                                many know that he was born with very weak legs and was not able to stand

                                                own legs until the age of 6. After all the doctors of that era gave up
                                                hope, his
                                                Grandma Mrs Renuka Devi nurtured the young Shailu by giving her home

                                                treatment for years and made sure the young Shailu not only stood but
                                                walk and
                                                later on travel to multiple countries.

                                                During this time of nurturing, as Shailu
                                                was unable to walk, he spent a lot of time in the kitchen when his
                                                grandma was
                                                busy cooking for a huge joint family. During those times in the kitchen
                                                his
                                                favorite toys was a small knife, a cutting board, a mortar and pestle
                                                not just
                                                for playing but to help his grandma by chopping onions, garlic,
                                                vegetables,
                                                greens, crush hard spices and even grind the masala for the curries
                                                using the
                                                stone hand grinder. The taste and aromas of his Grandma’s cooking
                                                registered a
                                                permanent memory in him and he was also able to keenly observe the
                                                process of
                                                meticulous cooking his grandma followed.
